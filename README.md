# NEThan

Node.js implementation of a neural network named NEThan (a terrible word play on 'NETwork') to play tic tac toe.

To install, please make sure you have node installed. This can be done by typing 'brew install node' into the terminal. This in turn requires Homebrew, which can be installed by typing the following into your terminal:

  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Otherwise, simply type 'node play'! A Nethan instance will automatically be loaded into the play script based on the description provided by 'nethan.json'. Nethan currently only plays noughts, with the human user going first, playing crosses.
